                <p>One thing that I have always been fascinated about is destruction in games. Giving the player the ability to break stuff into pieces brings another level of immersion.</p>
                <p>However, that often comes at a price due to the heavy computation from the rigidbodies colliding with each other.</p>

              <h1>Maya-Baked Destructions</h1>
              <p>In game dev, there is often a saying 'Fake it till you make it'. If you can't use real-time destruction, fake it
                till it looks believeable, which is what I did.
              </p>
              <p>I started off using baked destructions by shattering models in Maya before bringing them into Unity.
                The result was consistent. Well, at the expense of realism of course since it is the same meshes being instantiated every single time.
              </p>
              <p>That quickly got boring as I wanted the player to feel that they could affect geometry in unique ways. For example, shooting a bullet
                in a thin wall should create a hole right down the middle, with cracks and fractures along the wall and not destroy the wall entirely.

              <h1>Creating Triangulations</h1>
              <p>It was around this time, when I chanced upon a github repo about using delaunay triangulations to create destructions in real-time. 
                While it might not be very scalable due to the real-time calculations, it was a good starting point as the results were really
                interesting.</p>
              <p>I read that to create voronoi diagrams, and thus voronoi fractures, one can use the dual graph of its delaunay triangulation to achieve that.
                Since this was rather math heavy, I started off trying to create delaunay triangulation in 2D.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-about">
              <h1>2D Delaunay Triangulation</h1>
              <p>There are many ways to achieve delaunay triangulation and I decided on using the Bowyer-Watson algorithm. It was intuitive:
                Insert a point, find all the bad triangles, retriangulate, rinse and repeat.
              </p>
              <p>There were roadblocks initially due to a lack of understanding but I quickly got over it. The result was fascinating, seeing
                random points being triangulated in such a beautiful way, only a nerd could understand (haha). However,
                things came to a stop when I tried implementing 3D delaunay triangulations.

            </div>
            <div class="content-about">
              <h1>3D Delaunay Triangulation</h1>
              <p>You see, the problem with 3D is that instead of finding bad triangles, you have to find all the bad tetrahedrons and retetrahedralise them.
                There are also multiple possible triangulations for a given set of points which meant that it was difficult to see the problem visually.
                This also means that the computation becomes increasingly expensive and based on my current understanding, I have yet to get it to work.

            <div class="content-about">
              <h1>Future Plans</h1>
              <p>While I have stopped working on this at the moment, I will definitely come back to relook and try to implement this again. Perhaps, I will also look at other alternatives like GPU-baked destructions. Stay tuned!</p>
